        Your task is to:
        - âœ… Return the **exact same JSON** if it is valid.
        - ðŸ”§ If the JSON is invalid, correct it and return the **fixed** JSON object.
        - Correct any issues (e.g., invalid escape characters like \\_, trailing commas, etc.).
        - Fix only what is required to make it valid.
        - Do **not** escape normal characters like underscores (_), dashes (-), or spaces.
        - All keys **must be in snake_case** (e.g., step_number, chain_of_thought).
        - DO NOT use spaces in keys like "step number".
        - Use consistent key names every time.

        ðŸš« DO NOT:
        - Add any explanation, formatting, or comments.
        - Add any text before or after the JSON.
        - Return more than one JSON object â€” only return the first one.
        - Use markdown or code blocks.

        ðŸ“Œ The output must:
        - Begin with {{ and end with }}.
        - Contain a **single JSON object only**.
        - Be completely valid and parseable.
